        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Wheat dosa</strong> is a quick and easy dosa variety made with 
            <strong>whole wheat flour, rice flour, onions or shallots, herbs and spices.</strong> 
            It is also called as <strong><em>Godhuma Dosa</em> </strong>
            or <strong><em>Atta Dosa.</em></strong>
            There are many variations of making this wheat flour dosa. 
            My recipe makes for a crispy dosa and the texture is similar to 
            Rava Dosa which is made from semolina. 
            Make this wheat dosa when you are craving a quick and healthy snack or breakfast.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Take <strong>1 cup</strong> whole wheat flour (atta) and <strong>¼ cup</strong> 
                rice flour in a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>¼ cup</strong>  sliced shallots or ¼ cup chopped onions.</li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong>  chopped curry leaves.</li>
            <li><strong>½ teaspoon</strong> of finely chopped ginger.</li>
            <li><strong>½ teaspoon</strong> cumin seeds.</li>
            <li><strong>pinch</strong> of hing (asafoetida).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Take wheat flour</strong> (atta) and <strong>rice flour</strong> in a mixing bowl.</p>
                <p>If you have coarser wheat flour or your flour 
                has a lot of bran then do sift it once or twice.
                <em>The rice flour helps to give a crispy texture.</em></p></li>
            <li> 
                <p><strong>Add ingredients</strong> from <em>Ingredients</em> list.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Add 2.5 cups water</strong> or as required. 
                    Depending on the quality of atta, 
                    you can add less or more water.</p>
                <p>The batter has to be <strong><em>flowing and thin.</em></strong>  
                   <em>If the batter looks thick or has a medium consistency, 
                    then add more water.</em></p>
                <p><em>If the batter looks very thin and runny, 
                    then add some rice flour.</em></p></li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Mix very well.</strong> There can be fine lumps 
                    of the atta like wet sand types, 
                    so break these while mixing.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p><em>You can <strong>use your hands</strong></em> also to mix the batter. 
                Even a <strong>wired whisk</strong> can be used.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Now add <em>1 teaspoon</em> lemon juice</strong> for some tang.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Season with salt</strong> as per taste. <strong>Mix again.</strong></p></li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Cover the bowl and let the batter rest for about <strong>30 minutes.</strong></em></p></li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>After 30 minutes</strong>, you will see water 
                    floating on top and the flours will settle at the bottom.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p> <strong>Mix the batter thoroughly again</strong>, 
                    before you start to cook the wheat dosa.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Heat</strong> the tava or <em>non-stick pan</em> or a <a>skillet</em></p></li>
